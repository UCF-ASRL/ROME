Welcome to the Rapid Orbit Manipulating Emulator (ROME). This has been an ongoing project for a few years with multiple iterations. The first project members experimented with a 3-wheeled robot and built an open-source 6-degree-of-freedom robotic arm from Chris Annin. The following is a paper written about the dynamics of this system.

Much of this project requires the knowledge of programming in Arduino, MATLAB, and ROS.
Please use the following if you wish to learn more about each.

The current iteration of the ASRL robotic arm is equivalent to Chris Anninâ€™s AR4 Robot, which his documentation can be found here (https://www.anninrobotics.com/)
